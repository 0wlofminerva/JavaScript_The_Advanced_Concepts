ReferenceError: i is not defined

// if I set 'let' instead of 'var'
// I get a reference error
// ReferenceError: i is not defined
// because we are trying to use 'i' outside of its enviroment
// out its block scope
// the environment that is in, is iinside those cuurly brackets
// I cannot access outside these curly brackets

// this may have unintended consecuences
// maybe you do want to print this properly

// there are cases where the variable keyword still useful
// we have a way to have block scope whenever we needed

// block scoping means declarring a variable
// not just inside a function
// but arround any curly brackets
// ie if statements, loops

// the 1variable itself 'let i' still in memory // the engine wont allow you to access it unlike if you use var

// this way we get to keep our mental framework of execution context & variable environmet
// but also have the 'let & const' that give us some of the power that give us scoping
