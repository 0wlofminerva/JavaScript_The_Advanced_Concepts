// /////////////////////////////////////////// 20. Reviewing FP

// Welcome back

// now that we have gone through the functional programming concept
// I hope you  understand the idea of going from procedural to functional programming
// at the end of the day a functiion withouut a return statement
// is just a procedure
// functional programming gave us this idea of pure function
// & functions are useful because
// well we limit repetitions
// every time that we use a function
// is something that is reusable
// reuse that function somewhere else
// now one thing that you may have realize
// is that although functional programming 
// has different concepts than object oriented programing
// at the ende of the day the goal is still the same
// to have these things in mind to write a better code
// fuunctional programming just like object oriented programming
// is all about making your code predictable
// now the  one benefit of functioinal programming that you may have notice
// is that is really really good at doing one to one data transformations
// that is we have a piece of data & we have function acting upon
// & in the next section we are gonna compare 
// objet oriented programming with functioinal programming
// to really have a better general understanding of when to use what
// to review what we have learnt up untill now
// we have noticed that functioinal programming
// is quite powerful
// & when you start doing a lot of fuunctional programmiing
// you are gonna start to see a trend towards this idea of list & elmeents of a list
// this idea of list being transformed based on these little functions
// & these list well we use arrays as an example
// but it can be any data structure
// the objects, it can be trees, it can be anything that you want acting uupon data
// the thinking with fuunctional programming
// is that it lays the foundation for creating this reusable code
// that we can move pieces of functions arround
// to do different things based on ouur needs
// & the reason that we are able to do all fo this
// was because of javascript makes it easy to assign functions to variables
// pass them into other functions
// return functions from functions
// compose functions
// pipe functions
// javascript also allows us to use immutable concepts
// like primitive types or using map or concat on arrays
// object dot assign
// cloning objects using spread operators
// & we have learnt a lot of difficult functional programming terms
// but at the end of the day
// all the terms mean is that we are building pure functions
// & we are trying have as many pure functions as possible
// trying avoid mutating state as much as we can
// in order to have clean predictable code

// & by the way using waht we have learnt now
// you might look at library code different
// for example in our robot friends redux app
// which is an app we build in one of my other courses
// if we go to containers in app dot js
// & we scroll all the way down
// this is an app buuild with react redux
// & you can see over here that this conect well reminds a lot of compose
// doesnt it?
// we take the app
// which is our entire front end application
// the view of the front end application
// & we add different things to it
// so that we take this data this view
// & we add properties
// & we add map state to props
// sort of like actions
// all the way up
// even if we dont know anything about react
// we see that map state to props
// & map dispatch to props
// are taking some sort of state or actions
// & returning once again objects
// we can attach to our app
// things like redux really popuralize the idea of
// functioinal programming for javascripit developers
// specially front end javascripit developers
// you start to see know that reducers in redux well they are doing the same thing
// they have state that they receive in some actions & based on those actions
// return a new state
// you see these paradigms that were developed over decades
// are now being uused by some of the most poppular libraries for javascript
// & other programming languages
// & I hope with this section
// you start to notice these little thiings
// there is not actually extremely clever people
// that you will never be able to understand
// or you will never be able to be as good as they are
// all these programers are just using the skills
// the paradigms that people in the past have learnt & have adapted
// so I hope now you have a better way to look at code & understand it
// I  see you in the next one
// bye bye
