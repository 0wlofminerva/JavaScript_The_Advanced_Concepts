/////////////////////////////////////////// 6. Object Oriented Programming
/////////////////////////////////////////// 1. Section Overview

// welcome back
// we finally made it here
// it took a while
// but we are in probably the most exciting section atleast for me
// we are going to be talking about
// object oriented programming
// & functional programming
// both of these are what we call programming paradigms
// object oriented programming &
// functional programming
// are paradigms that allow us to organize code
// in a way that is easy to reason about
// what does really mean?
// by the end of this section
// after we hae done talk about OOP & FP
// My goal is that you realize these benefits

// one is that by using these paradigms 

// we are gonna make code more clear & more understandable

// we are gonna make code easy to extend, that is as our app grows,
// as our program grows, as the number of developers working on a project grow,
// is easier to extend using these programming paradigms.

// I am also going to convince to you how its easier to mantain in multiple programms.

// its going to be memory efficient,

// & then finally its going to keep our code dry,
// that is we dont repeat ourself, our code its gonna be nice & clean

// & we are gonna have all these benefits,
// because of these programming paradigms,
// & thats what programming paradigms are.
// it allows us to make complex code more organized

// now, before we even had OOP & FP
// we had machine code
// initially were all ones & ceros
// that programmers used

// & then as time pass
// we went into something procedural style of programming

// in a procedural style of programming is that
// we did what computers want us to do
// that it we would store data 
// & we manipulate that data using some sort of functions 
// but there were no structure or organization
// we just have step by step instructions of 
// Hey computer put memory here
// Hey computer move this memory here
// Hey computer change the memory here & then give me this
// everything was procedural

// & I link to this wikipedia article
// which I think really really intersting
// if you wanna give it a go
// as I sayed before initially we started with some basic programming languages
// really low level languages
// you have things like BASIC, Assembly language, COBOL

// & throughout the 60s & 70s a big change happened
// we started to establishing this fundamental paradigms
// How can you write code in a more organized fashion?

// it wasnt as procedural, 
// thats when object oriented programming & functional programming
// starting to really take effect
// we have languages like Scheme which we mention was one of the inspiration of javascript
// we have languuages like smalltalk that really popularized this idea of 
// object oriented programming as a way to organize this code

// & then finally in the 80s as more & more best practices
// satrt to happen
// we started to having more of a consolidation
// that is people agree on whats good patterns are
// we had things like modules
// tha once again we arre gonna talk about & we will have a section on it
// object oriented programming really started taking off
// you see we had languages like C++ that came into existence
// && C++ was the original C language with classes
// classes which allow us to do object oriented language
// we had Objective-C as the name suggests it was a C based language 
// inspired by the idea of objects & object oriented programming
// & then really started to take effect
// at the same time in the background we also had functional programming
// in the 90s with the age of the internet we started having to more languages
// Java became extremely popular with the object oriented programming paradigm
// we had javascript that came as the language of the web 
// & many other languages that we are familiar with

// now object oriented programming kept up with the trends
// was really really popularize by things like Java
// however we see a trend towards
// functional programing languages becoming more & more popular
// mostly because of the way that the paradigm works
// how well it works with concurrent & distributed programming
// & something that we will touch on later on

// I highly recomend you go through this article its really really fascinating
// but the whole point of this
// was that as the years progress
// programmers as we work more & more with code
// we start develop an idea of what are good practices
// what should be do?
// object oriented programming & functional programming
// were the two strong paradigms that evolve
// so by learning these two things
// we get to stand on shoulders of giants
// we learnt what are the good practices
// that all these programmers that came before us learnt
// they made mistakes & then they changed in the way tthat tehy program
// so that we write better code
// & in this section we are gonna learnt just that
// we are gonna learnt from everybody  mistake in the past
// we are gonna learnt from all the ideas
// & all the ways that we can write better programs
// I hope it gets you exiceted
// it definetelly does for me

// I see you in the next video bye bye
